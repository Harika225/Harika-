        "1. What are variables in Python and how are they declared?\n",
        "A)In Python, variables are fundamental building blocks that act as containers for storing data values. Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "What are Variables?\n",
        " * Containers for Data:\n",
        "   * Think of variables as labeled boxes in your computer's memory. They hold information that your program can use.\n",
        " * Symbolic Names:\n",
        "   * Variables provide a way to give meaningful names to data, making your code easier to read and understand.\n",
        " * Dynamic Typing:\n",
        "   * Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned to it.\n",
        "How are Variables Declared?\n",
        " * Assignment Operator (=):\n",
        "   * You create a variable by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (=).\n",
        "   * Example: my_variable = 10\n",
        " * Implicit Declaration:\n",
        "   * Unlike some other programming languages, Python doesn't require you to declare variables before using them. The moment you assign a value, the variable is created.\n",
        " * Example Scenarios:\n",
        "   * name = \"Alice\" (string)\n",
        "   * age = 30 (integer)\n",
        "   * price = 9.99 (float)\n",
        "   * is_valid = True (boolean)\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        " * Variable names should be descriptive and follow Python's naming conventions (e.g., start with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores).\n",
        " * Python allows you to reassign variables, meaning you can change the value they hold during the program's execution.\n",
        " * Variables are how you store and manipulate data within python programs.\n",

        "\n",
        "ANS:Python has several built-in data types that are used to represent different kinds of values. Here's a breakdown of the most fundamental ones:\n",
        "1. Numeric Types:\n",
        " * int (Integers):\n",
        "   * These represent whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal points.\n",
        "   * Example: 10, -5, 0\n",
        " * float (Floating-point numbers):\n",
        "   * These represent real numbers with decimal points.\n",
        "   * Example: 3.14, -2.5, 0.0\n",
        " * complex (Complex numbers):\n",
        "   * These represent numbers with a real and an imaginary part.\n",
        "   * Example: 2 + 3j\n",
        "2. Sequence Types:\n",
        " * str (Strings):\n",
        "   * These represent sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.\n",
        "   * Example: \"Hello\", 'Python'\n",
        " * list (Lists):\n",
        "   * These represent ordered, mutable (changeable) sequences of items.\n",
        "   * Example: [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
        " * tuple (Tuples):\n",
        "   * These represent ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequences of items.\n",
        "   * Example: (1, 2, 3), ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')\n",
        " * range (Ranges):\n",
        "   * These represent a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used for looping a specific number of times.\n",
        "3. Mapping Type:\n",
        " * dict (Dictionaries):\n",
        "   * These represent key-value pairs, allowing you to store and retrieve data using keys.\n",
        "   * Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}\n",
        "4. Boolean Type:\n",
        " * bool (Booleans):\n",
        "   * These represent truth values, either True or False.\n",
        "5. Set Types:\n",
        " * set (Sets):\n",
        "   * These are unordered collections of unique elements.\n",
        " * frozenset (Frozen sets):\n",
        "   * These are immutable versions of sets.\n",
        "6. Binary Types:\n",
        " * bytes:\n",
        "   * Immutable sequences of single bytes.\n",
        " * bytearray:\n",
        "   * Mutable sequences of single bytes.\n",
        " * memoryview:\n",
        "   * A memory view object allows access to the internal data of an object that supports the buffer protocol without copying.\n",
        "These data types are the foundation for working with data in Python."

        "   * For example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.\n",
        "   * It essentially stores a value in a memory location and labels it with the variable name.\n",
        " * == (Equality Operator):\n",
        "   * This operator is used to compare whether two values are equal.\n",
        "   * It returns a Boolean value: True if the values are equal, and False if they are not.\n",
        "   * For example: if x == 5: checks if the value of x is equal to 5.\n",
        "Here's a simple way to summarize the difference:\n",
        " * = : \"Make this variable equal to this value.\"\n",
        " * == : \"Is this value equal to that value?\"\n",
